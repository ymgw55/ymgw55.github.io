Academic is very functional, that is, there are many choices to customize, however, it is sometimes too much for me. That is why I take notes for some practical settings for my own in this page.\nBy using Academic, we can make pages from markdown, without setting HTML or CSS, because generators generates such kinds of files automatically.\nSetting for menu bar Go to config/_default/menus.toml, and we can change setting for display, sequence, and link about items on menu bar such as Home, Posts, and so on.\nSetting for bibliography Go to content/authors/admin/_index.md.\nSetting for home page Go to content/home/*.md, and then we can change setting for display and so on. For example, in the case of posts.md, that markdown file interact with content/post/, and we can decide how many directories display.\nSetting for [username].github.io/* For example, in the case of [username].github.io/post, go to `content/post/_index.md, and then we can change setting for title or subtitle on home page.\nHow to make new pages If you want to know detail, go to this official document. For example, in the case of making new post, type hugo new --kind post post/my-article-name in terminal, and then the new folder whose name is my-article-name is made automatically, so we can write contents on index.md in the folder. In this case, to show a new page in home, you go to content/home/posts.md and ensure active = true.\nHow to write technical content Go to official demo pages.\nSetting for contact Go to config/_default/params.toml, and then we can change setting for our telephone number, our street address and so on.\nHow to check changes Type hugo server in terminal, and then hugo server starts and we can go to localhost:1313 for checking changes.\n  ","date":1579387391,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579387391,"objectID":"89295fdf4b5d5f97ef8a98af1c82ac15","permalink":"/post/how-to-use-academic/","publishdate":"2020-01-19T07:43:11+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-use-academic/","section":"post","summary":"memo","tags":["GitHub","Academic-theme"],"title":"How to use Academic","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let's make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
