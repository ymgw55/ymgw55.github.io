Academic is very functional, that is, there are many choices to customize, however, it is sometimes too much for me. That is why I take notes for some practical settings for my own in this page.\nBy using Academic, we can make pages from markdown, without setting HTML or CSS, because generators generates such kinds of files automatically.\nSetting for menu bar Go to config/_default/menus.toml, and we can change setting for display, sequence, and link about items on menu bar such as Home, Posts, and so on.\nSetting for bibliography Go to content/authors/admin/_index.md.\nSetting for home page Go to content/home/*.md, and then we can change setting for display and so on. For example, in the case of posts.md, that markdown file interact with content/post/, and we can decide how many directories display.\nSetting for [username].github.io/* For example, in the case of [username].github.io/post, go to `content/post/_index.md, and then we can change setting for title or subtitle on home page.\nHow to make new pages If you want to know detail, go to this official document. For example, in the case of making new post, type hugo new --kind post post/my-article-name in terminal, and then the new folder whose name is my-article-name is made automatically, so we can write contents on index.md in the folder. In this case, to show a new page in home, you go to content/home/posts.md and ensure active = true.\nHow to write technical content Go to official demo pages.\nSetting for contact Go to config/_default/params.toml, and then we can change setting for our telephone number, our street address and so on.\nHow to check changes Type hugo server in terminal, and then hugo server starts and we can go to localhost:1313 for checking changes.\n  ","date":1579387391,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579387391,"objectID":"89295fdf4b5d5f97ef8a98af1c82ac15","permalink":"/post/how-to-use-academic/","publishdate":"2020-01-19T07:43:11+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-use-academic/","section":"post","summary":"memo","tags":["GitHub","Academic-theme"],"title":"How to use Academic","type":"post"}]
