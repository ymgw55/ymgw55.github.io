Our approach extracts independent semantic components of embeddings, enabling each embedding to be represented as a composition of intrinsic interpretable axes. We demonstrate that embeddings can be expressed as a combination of a few axes and that these semantic axes are consistent across different languages, modalities, and embedding algorithms. This discovery of universal properties in embeddings contributes to model interpretability, potentially facilitating the development of highly interpretable models and the compression of large-scale models.","tags":["NLP","ICA"],"title":"Discovering Universal Geometry in Embeddings with ICA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa","Sho Yokoi","Hidetoshi Shimodaira"],"categories":["EMNLP2023"],"content":"","date":1701788400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701788400,"objectID":"528096e39d85009403bb7a9600cb2513","permalink":"/publication/wsmd/","publishdate":"2022-11-14T16:10:19+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wsmd/","section":"publication","summary":"Measuring the semantic similarity between two sentences is still an important task. The word mover’s distance (WMD) computes the similarity via the optimal alignment between the sets of word embeddings. However, WMD does not utilize word order, making it difficult to distinguish sentences with large overlaps of similar words, even if they are semantically very different. Here, we attempt to improve WMD by incorporating the sentence structure represented by BERT’s self-attention matrix (SAM). The proposed method is based on the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance, which simultaneously considers the similarity of the word embedding and the SAM for calculating the optimal transport between two sentences. Experiments on paraphrase identification and semantic textual similarity show that the proposed method improves WMD and its variants.

SAM is a foundation model for segmentation tasks, and one of the interesting applications of SAM is Automatic Mask Generation (AMG), which generates zero-shot segmentation masks of an entire image. AMG can be applied to edge detection, but suffers from the problem of overdetecting edges. Edge detection with SCESAME overcomes this problem by three steps: (1) eliminating small generated masks, (2) combining masks by spectral clustering, taking into account mask positions and overlaps, and (3) removing artifacts after edge detection. We performed edge detection experiments on two datasets, BSDS500 and NYUDv2. Although our zero-shot approach is simple, the experimental results on BSDS500 showed almost identical performance to human performance and CNN-based methods from seven years ago. In the NYUDv2 experiments, it performed almost as well as recent CNN-based methods. These results indicate that our method has the potential to be a strong baseline for future zero-shot edge detection methods. Furthermore, SCESAME is not only applicable to edge detection, but also to other downstream zero-shot tasks.","tags":["CV","SAM","Edge-Detection"],"title":"Zero-Shot Edge Detection with SCESAME: Spectral Clustering-based Ensemble for Segment Anything Model Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa","Ryoma Hashimoto","Kiwamu Arakane","Ken Murakami","Momose Oyama","Hidetoshi Shimodaira","Mariko Okada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688102400,"objectID":"1158cea8612330edca323f7855c3237c","permalink":"/talk/ibisml50/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T22:59:21+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ibisml50/","section":"talk","summary":"第50回IBISML研究会 (NC, BIO, MPS共催)","tags":[],"title":"生物学的パスウェイを用いたBioConceptVecにおけるアナロジータスク","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1680972750,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680972750,"objectID":"909085c43fcec2539687606487a55d82","permalink":"/project/mlpapers/","publishdate":"2023-04-09T01:52:30+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/mlpapers/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mlpapers","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa","Sho Yokoi","Hidetoshi Shimodaira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662270000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662270000,"objectID":"91d5f4008904deb1e34ac85b5c1ca6c8","permalink":"/talk/jfssa2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-14T16:43:01+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/jfssa2022/","section":"talk","summary":"2022年度統計関連学会連合大会","tags":[],"title":"Self-Attention 行列を用いた最適輸送距離に基づく言い換え識別","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa","Sho Yokoi","Hidetoshi Shimodaira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636527600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636527600,"objectID":"399f781d7edabe82179f9c05e8e75004","permalink":"/talk/ibis2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-11T01:41:37+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ibis2021/","section":"talk","summary":"第24回情報論的学習理論ワークショップ (IBIS 2021)","tags":[],"title":"BERTのパラメータを用いた最適輸送距離に基づく言い換え識別の性能評価","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa","Sho Yokoi","Hidetoshi Shimodaira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630391400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630391400,"objectID":"63bc9c5a84fc8518e9beeea59844ea08","permalink":"/talk/yans2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-30T20:51:18+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/yans2021/","section":"talk","summary":"NLP若手の会 第16回シンポジウム (YANS 2021)","tags":[],"title":"Self-AttentionとFused Gromov–Wasserstein距離に基づく文類似度計算","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hiroaki Yamagiwa"],"categories":["settings"],"content":"Hugo 静的サイトジェネレーター\nwowchemy 旧Academic. 早めに wowchemy の仕様に移行する必要あり.
